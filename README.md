This is a collaborated repositry of Ramanathan, Akhil Krishnan Sunil and Anirudh for Deep Learning course Project

Data Set: It contains 47693 sentences, each tagged with a cyberbullying sentiment type, such as race, gender, religion, age, and not a cyberbullying sentence.

Model: The objective of this research is to do a sentiment analysis using bidirectional LSTM on content we scraped and stored in .csv regarding cyberbullying. We also compare the findings with SVM, Naive Bayes, Decison Tree, Random Forest, and Gradiant Boosting models. We use semantic similarity and NLP techniques in our proposed approach to better accuracy than the existing generic models.

-> Git clone the repo
-> Open the code in Jupter Notebook
-> Run all the cells

Note: Sematic similarity code has been made into a comment line using '#' as it uses around 16GB of RAM; if you would like to run it with the particular resources available, do remove the '#' in the sematic code block and run.
